## Algorithm Benchmarking

#### Computational Thinking &amp; Algorithms Module Project
---

 <!-- Introduction (10%): Introduce the concept of sorting and sorting algorithms, discuss the relevance of concepts such
as complexity (time and space), performance, in-place sorting, stable sorting, comparator functions, comparison-based
and non-comparison-based sorts, etc.
• Sorting Algorithms (5 x 5 = 25%): Introduce each of your chosen algorithms in turn, discuss their space and
time complexity, and explain how each algorithm works using your own bespoke diagrams and diﬀerent example input
instances. If you diagrams are not original creations you will get zero.
• Implementation & Benchmarking (25%): This section will describe the process followed when implementing the
application above, and will present the results of your benchmarking. Discuss how the measured performance of the
algorithms diﬀered – were the results similar to what you would expect, given the time complexity of each chosen
algorithm? In this section you should use both a table and a graph to summarise the results obtained (see samples
below). -->

This Java application benchmarks 5 sorting algorithms - measuring time (T) for varying input data sizes (N).
